TinyPNG API

Python module and command line tool for api.tinypng.org

Important: You require an API key which you may obtain from
info@tinypng.org (as of October 2012).

Besides specifying keys via command line arguments you can
    1. Set the environment variable TINYPNG_API_KEY
    2. Create a .tinypng.keys file in your home directory
    3. Create a tinypng.keys file in the current directory

Keyfiles must have one key per line. Invalid keys should
be removed as they slow down requests.
